# Simple nodejs, react, react-router-template

The other templates that I found were filled with tools and packages I didn't use so I decided to make one for myself, if you happen to come along this feel free to use it :)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

* Just clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/aDarcy99/nodejs-react-router-template.git
```

* Then create a git ignore with node_modules

* Then install the npm packages using:

```
npm install
```
